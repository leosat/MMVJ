# User can specify custom sections with reusable chunks for YAML.
# Referenced with anchors (&) and reused below with merge keys (<<:) 
#
Shared user-defined MIDI controls example:
  C4 note: &note_c4
    midi_message: { type: note, channel: any, number: 60 }
    range: [0, 127]
    description: Middle C (velocity used as value) user-defined.
  Another name for C4: { <<: *note_c4 }
  Any note, clamped to On or Off states: &note_any__on_off
    midi_message: { type: note, channel: any }
    range: [0, 1] # We can specify custom initial range and if the input value is out of it
                  # the value will be assigned and clamped (see below) to it.
                  # So, value transformation strarts with specifying the value range and goes on
                  # in mappings, see below.
    description: Any note, saturated early (every value not set to 0 will resulte in max output),
                 user-defined.
  #
  # With this notation we reuse a predefined control 
  # without overriding any of its properties.
  # 
  # Predefined controls can bee seen in mmvj_cfg_predefines.yaml.
  #
  Pitch: PITCH_WHEEL
  #
  # With this notation we reuse a predefined control 
  # but redefine the control input range. E.g. here we make 
  # anything that is -1 or less and 1 and more saturate below and above those bounds.
  # This results in effect that a pitch wheel if mapped from this control definition
  # will behave as a tripolar button having values of -1,0,1.
  #
  # Predefined controls can bee seen in mmvj_cfg_predefines.yaml.
